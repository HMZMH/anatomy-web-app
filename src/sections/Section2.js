            <h3>Muscular System</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The muscular system is composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers.</li>
                <li>Their predominant function is contractibility.</li>
                <li>Muscles, attached to bones or internal organs and blood vessels, are responsible for movement.</li>
                <li>Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction.</li>
                <li>Exceptions to this include the action of cilia, the flagellum on sperm cells, and amoeboid movement of some white blood cells.</li>
                <li>The integrated action of joints, bones, and skeletal muscles produces obvious movements such as walking and running.</li>
                <li>Skeletal muscles also produce more subtle movements that result in various facial expressions, eye movements, and respiration.</li>
                <li>Muscle contraction fulfills other important functions in the body, such as posture, joint stability, and heat production.</li>
                <li>Posture, such as sitting and standing, is maintained as a result of muscle contraction.</li>
                <li>The skeletal muscles continually make fine adjustments to hold the body in stationary positions.</li>
                <li>The tendons of many muscles extend over joints and contribute to joint stability.</li>
                <li>This is particularly evident in the knee and shoulder joints where muscle tendons play a major role in stabilizing the joint.</li>
                <li>Heat production, to maintain body temperature, is an important by-product of muscle metabolism.</li>
                <li>Nearly 85 percent of the heat produced in the body is the result of muscle contraction.</li>
            </ul>
