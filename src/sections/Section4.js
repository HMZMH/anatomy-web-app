            <h3>Endocrine System</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The endocrine system, along with the nervous system, regulates body activities.</li>
                <li>The nervous system uses electrical impulses and neurotransmitters for short-duration, localized effects (seconds).</li>
                <li>The endocrine system uses hormones to influence growth, development, and metabolic activities for longer periods (minutes, hours, or weeks).</li>
                <li>There are two major categories of glands in the body: Exocrine and Endocrine.</li>
                <li>Exocrine glands have ducts to carry their secretory product to a surface.</li>
                <li>Examples of exocrine glands include sweat, sebaceous, mammary glands, and those that secrete digestive enzymes.</li>
                <li>Endocrine glands do not have ducts and are ductless; they secrete hormones directly into the blood.</li>
                <li>The term "endocrine" is derived from the Greek words "endo" (within) and "krine" (to separate or secrete).</li>
                <li>Secretory products of endocrine glands are hormones that influence cells with receptor sites for those hormones throughout the body.</li>
            </ul>
