            <h3>Nervous System</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The nervous system is the major controlling, regulatory, and communicating system in the body.</li>
                <li>It is the center of all mental activity, including thought, learning, and memory.</li>
                <li>Together with the endocrine system, it regulates and maintains homeostasis.</li>
                <li>Through its receptors, the nervous system keeps us in touch with our environment, both external and internal.</li>
                <li>Composed of organs, including the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia.</li>
                <li>These organs consist of various tissues, including nerve, blood, and connective tissue.</li>
                <li>The nervous system has three general functions: Sensory, Integrative, and Motor.</li>
                <li>Sensory receptors detect changes (stimuli) inside and outside the body, monitoring factors like temperature, light, and sound.</li>
                <li>Receptors also detect internal changes in pressure, pH, carbon dioxide concentration, and electrolyte levels.</li>
                <li>All gathered information is known as sensory input.</li>
                <li>Sensory input is converted into nerve impulses, transmitted to the brain, and used for sensations, thoughts, and memory (integration).</li>
                <li>Decisions are made based on sensory input and integration.</li>
                <li>The nervous system responds by sending signals to muscles (causing contraction) and glands (causing secretions).</li>
                <li>Muscles and glands are effectors, acting based on directions from the nervous system (motor output or motor function).</li>
            </ul>
