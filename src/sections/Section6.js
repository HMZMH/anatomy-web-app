            <ul>
                <li>The lymphatic system has three primary functions:</li>
                <li>First, it returns excess interstitial fluid to the blood, with about 90 percent of the fluid leaving capillaries being returned.</li>
                <li>The remaining 10 percent becomes part of interstitial fluid around tissue cells.</li>
                <li>Lymph capillaries pick up excess fluid and proteins, preventing fluid accumulation and edema (swelling).</li>
                <li>Once fluid enters lymph capillaries, it's called lymph.</li>
                <li>The second function is absorbing fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the digestive system and transporting them to the venous circulation.</li>
                <li>Lacteals in the small intestine's villi absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins, forming chyle with a milky appearance.</li>
                <li>The third well-known function is defense against invading microorganisms and disease.</li>
                <li>Lymph nodes and other lymphatic organs filter lymph to remove microorganisms and foreign particles.</li>
                <li>Lymphatic organs contain lymphocytes that destroy invading organisms.</li>
            </ul>
