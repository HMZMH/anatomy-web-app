            <ul>
                <li>The respiratory system is not just about breathing; it has multiple functions.</li>
                <li>It provides a continuous supply of oxygen to body cells for metabolic processes necessary to maintain life.</li>
                <li>The respiratory system collaborates with the circulatory system to deliver oxygen and remove metabolic waste products, helping to regulate blood pH.</li>
                <li>Respiration is the process of exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and body cells.</li>
                <li>Nerve impulses stimulate ventilation (breathing) every 3 to 5 seconds, moving air into and out of the lungs through a series of passages.</li>
                <li>External respiration involves the exchange of gases between the lungs and the blood.</li>
                <li>The blood transports gases to and from tissue cells, constituting internal respiration.</li>
                <li>Cells use the oxygen for their specific activities in cellular metabolism or cellular respiration.</li>
                <li>Collectively, these activities make up the process of respiration.</li>
            </ul>
