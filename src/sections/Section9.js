            <ul>
                <li>The principal function of the urinary system is to maintain the volume and composition of body fluids within normal limits.</li>
                <li>It also functions as the excretory system, getting rid of waste products that accumulate due to cellular metabolism.</li>
                <li>While other organs like the lungs, skin, liver, and intestines play a role in excretion, the urinary system has the major responsibility.</li>
                <li>It regulates fluid volume by controlling the amount of water excreted in urine and maintains the concentration of electrolytes in body fluids.</li>
                <li>The urinary system also helps maintain normal blood pH.</li>
                <li>It secretes erythropoietin, regulating red blood cell production, and secretes renin to help control blood pressure.</li>
            </ul>
