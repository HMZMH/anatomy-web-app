            <ul>
                <li>The cardiovascular system, also known as the blood-vascular or circulatory system, includes the heart and a system of vessels: arteries, veins, and capillaries.</li>
                <li>Blood is pumped by the heart through a closed circuit of vessels, passing through various "circulations" in the body.</li>
                <li>During embryonic development, the cardiovascular system is crucial for maintaining homeostasis and a favorable cellular environment.</li>
                <li>It begins to function early in development and the heart starts beating regularly around the fourth week following fertilization.</li>
                <li>The cardiovascular system's vital role is to maintain homeostasis by ensuring controlled blood flow through capillaries that reach every cell in the body.</li>
                <li>Capillaries are where blood performs its transport function, allowing nutrients and essential materials to pass into the surrounding fluids while removing waste products.</li>
                <li>Control mechanisms regulate and integrate the functions of the cardiovascular system to supply blood to specific body areas according to need.</li>
                <li>These mechanisms maintain a constant internal environment around each body cell, regardless of varying demands for nutrients or waste production.</li>
            </ul>
