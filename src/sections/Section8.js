            <h3>Digestive System</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The digestive system processes food into molecules for cellular absorption and utilization.</li>
                <li>The digestive tract (alimentary canal or gastrointestinal tract) extends from the mouth to the anus and includes structures like the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine.</li>
                <li>Accessory structures in the digestive system include the tongue, teeth, salivary glands, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas.</li>
                <li>Food goes through three processes in the body: Digestion, Absorption, and Elimination.</li>
                <li>Digestion and absorption happen in the digestive tract, and nutrients are then available for all body cells for metabolism.</li>
                <li>The digestive system performs six key activities or functions:</li>
                <li>Ingestion: Taking in food through the mouth.</li>
                <li>Mechanical Digestion: Breaking large food pieces into smaller particles through chewing and stomach actions.</li>
                <li>Chemical Digestion: Transforming complex molecules into smaller, absorbable ones using digestive enzymes and water.</li>
                <li>Movements: Food particles move through the digestive tract via deglutition (swallowing) and peristalsis.</li>
                <li>Absorption: Simple molecules from chemical digestion pass into blood or lymph capillaries in the small intestine.</li>
                <li>Elimination: Indigestible wastes are removed from the body through defecation (elimination of feces).</li>
            </ul>
